## ðŸ“Š Dataset: BraTS 2021

- **Modality Used**: FLAIR (single modality)
- **Format**: 3D MRI `.nii.gz` files (only 2D slices were used for training)
- **Task**: Binary segmentation (tumor vs. non-tumor)

---

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- **Model**: U-Net++
- **Encoder**: ResNet34 via `segmentation_models_pytorch`
- **Data Augmentation**: Albumentations library used for real-time augmentations including horizontal/vertical flips, rotations, and intensity scaling
- **Loss Function**: Combination of Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) and Dice Loss
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Dice Coefficient
  - Intersection over Union (IoU)
